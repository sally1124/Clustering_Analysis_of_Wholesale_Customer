# Wholesale_Customer_Data_Analysis

### Project Introduction
Company XYZ is a wholesale distributor that serves a number of business clients in Portugal. The management team of XYZ would like to get a deeper understanding of the spending patterns of their clients so that the team can make strategic decisions to better meet the client’s demand and improve inventory management.

To help Company XYZ best understand the clients’ spending patterns, we have performed clustering analysis techniques leveraging R.

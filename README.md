### Project Introduction
Company XYZ is a wholesale distributor that serves several business clients in Portugal. The management team of XYZ would like to get a deeper understanding of the spending patterns of their clients so that the team can make strategic decisions to meet the client’s demands better and improve inventory management.

To help Company XYZ best understand the clients’ spending patterns, we have used clustering analysis techniques leveraging R. Additionally, we utilized Tableau for data exploration to provide the company with a more in-depth understanding of customer behavior.
